"""
This Fuzzer Hook detects lambda (and regular function) variable capture issues by getting the values of nonlocal
 variables (aka capture variables, aka free variables) as rules are set on locations and entrances, and then compares
 the values of the nonlocal variables again once the multiworld has finished generating, or whenever a new rule is set
 on the location/entrance.

Location.access_rule and Entrance.access_rule are monkey-patched into `property`-like descriptors to intercept set
 rules.
worlds.generic.Rules.add_rule is monkey-patched to intercept added rules.
worlds.generic.Rules.add_rule had to be monkey-patched by replacing its `.__code__` due to the issue that importing
 worlds.generic.Rules causes all other worlds to import before the worlds.generic.Rules import resolves, and many of
 those worlds import worlds.generic.Rules.add_rule directly.

There are a couple of cases that this Hook cannot cover.
- If the rules are defined in a separate loop (and a capture issue occurs there), and then the rules are set onto
  Locations/Entrances in a second loop, this Hook will only see the rules being set after the capture issue has already
  occurred.
- If a rule is defined before a nonlocal variable it references has been defined, there is nothing for the Hook to
  compare against. In this case, the Hook tries to keep track of these rules by recording them onto the MultiWorld
  object, but the Hook cannot do this if the Location/Entrance the rule was set on does not yet belong to a Region that
  belongs to the MultiWorld.
