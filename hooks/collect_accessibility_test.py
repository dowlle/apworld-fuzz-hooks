    Hook that tests that collecting items into a state never reduces accessibility. Made by Mysteryem.

    Archipelago requires that collecting an item must only ever increase accessibility or have no effect on
    accessibility. If accessibility reduces when an item is collected, it can cause generation to crash or behave in a
    number of weird ways.

    This will noticeably increase the fuzzing duration because the hook iteratively collects 1 reachable advancement
    item at a time and finds all reachable locations after each item is collected.

    For better performance when fuzzing multiworlds with multiple slots, the hook assumes that each slot's logic only
    depends on collecting its own items, and not any items belonging to another slot.
